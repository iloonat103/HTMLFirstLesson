    <h2>Where I'm From</h2>

    <p>I'm from a small town in West Yorkshire called Batley. Born and raised here, it's the place I've called home my whole life. Batley has a close-knit community and a calm, peaceful vibe. I grew up going to school here, and some of my best memories are from simple moments with friends around town. It’s well-connected to Leeds and Bradford, which makes it the perfect balance between quiet and convenience.

<h2>My Achievements and Skills</h2>

<p>I went to high school locally, and after that, I enrolled in an Islamic institute to study Islamic sciences in more depth. That journey took me further — I spent a year in Egypt to immerse myself in the Arabic language and culture, which was an unforgettable experience. Later, I was blessed with the opportunity to study at the Islamic University of Madinah, where I spent four incredible years and earned a BA in Hadith and Islamic Studies.

    Living abroad taught me how to adapt, appreciate different cultures, and feel at home wherever I go. While Batley will always be where I’m from, I’ve grown to enjoy both the familiarity of my hometown and the adventure of living and learning in new environments.
